My name is Maria Borodkina, and I have a +15-year experience in sales support and analytics. During 9 years at Bonava (my latest employer), I went on a journey from the Sales Legal Support Specialist to Head of Sales Back Office and, finally, Head of Sales Analytics and Automation. I have recently completed a year-program in Data Science and I am currently considering any junior positions in data science as a starting point for applying my knowledge in practice and further professional development.
